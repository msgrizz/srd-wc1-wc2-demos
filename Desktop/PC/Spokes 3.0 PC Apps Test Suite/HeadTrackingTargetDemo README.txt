Take a look at this demo which shows the Heading, Pitch and Roll
and animates a target crosshair on the screen that moves around
based on your head angle.
 
NOTE: There is a known issue with PC headtracking API in that pitch and roll are sometimes reversed.

In this demo you can press R to switch them back again!

Key summary:
-	Escape – Quit
-	F – toggle full screen
-	R – reverse pitch and roll (to address known PC headtracking API issue)
-	C – recalibrate (zero angles), look at center of screen


 * INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
 * 
 *   - If you put headset on and look at center of the screen, after 2 second delay the
 *     head tracking and target sight will "auto-calibrate" to center of screen.
 *     
 *   - From that point on the target sight will track your head movements
 *   
 *   - If you take your headset off the target sight will stop tracking your movements
 *   and place itself back in center of screen
 *   
 *   - Note: F will toggle fullscreen. Escape to quit.
